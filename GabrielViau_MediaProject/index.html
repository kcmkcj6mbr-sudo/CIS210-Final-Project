        <h2>Welcome to my Media Gallery</h2>
        <p>This is my media gallery for the Hands-On: Personal Media Showcase assignment. The purpose of this website is to allow the user to get in touch with the basic senses of life that we often overlook in our busy schedules. We are taken through rainy mountain valleys to crickets in grasslands now long passed. I hope I could get you to reexperience things as they were.
