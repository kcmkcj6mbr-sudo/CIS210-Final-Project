                        <p>The "3 coin register bank" is an antique toy bank, commonly known as the Uncle Sam 3-Coin Register Bank, that was made of steel with a mechanical cash register design. It was designed to accept dimes, nickels, and quarters, and its built-in counter would prevent the bank from being opened until a total of $10 was deposited. These banks were first made by the Durable Toy & Novelty Company in the early 1900s and have been produced by various companies since.</p>
